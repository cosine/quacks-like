QuacksLike is a module for RSpec to add matchers that test if an
object is fully duck-typed to pretend to be another class.  This kind
of thing is really only necessary when passing such an object as the
return value in an API where you don't know exactly how it will be
consumed, but it needs to "quack like an Array" or something.  It does
its job by checking every instance method in the class that the target
object needs to "quack like" and makes sure the target both responds
to that method name and that the arity of the method is appropriate.

Usage (in RSpec files):
  require 'quacks_like'

  it "should return an object that quacks like a Hash" do
    my_func.should quack_like_a(Hash)
  end

  it "should return an object that does not quack like an Array" do
    my_func.should_not quack_like_an(Array)
  end
